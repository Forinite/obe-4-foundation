    ` With the increasing death rate in our world today, from lack of preventive an emergency care, there is need to embrace an initiative that sees these needs as eminent in these trying times.`,
    ` Many families are unable to pay for immediate healthcare when faced with emergent needs that are not usually planned for. Some interventions cannot wait, as they are time sensitive. CPR, blood transfusions, oxygen supplement and IV hydrations are examples of interventions that must be delivered immediately, to sustain life.`,
    ` As a young nurse in Nigeria, I witnessed many incidents of avoidable deaths, ranging from ignorance of preventing them to lack of proper interventions, giving rise to losses of many young people who should be around today.`,
    `  This not-for-profit organization has been set up to curb this menace while empowering the youth who are significantly unemployed in this region. We will continue to provide free trainings and employ people who have been picked up from the street and rehabilitated.`,
